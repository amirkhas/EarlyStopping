This repo has all the code to run the Chain-of-Embedding code and run clustering algorithms for BoN





First run main.py to run inference on the dataset and save the COE scores and hidden_states

Then run calc_reward to save the rewards

Then run any of the filter bon, 2inference or good turing for different experiments.
